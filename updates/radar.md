## 2026-06-16 — initial seed

**dlt (dlthub)** — Databricks destination is mature: Unity Catalog integration, **Delta (default) +
Iceberg** via `table_format`, PRIMARY/FOREIGN KEY constraints from `primary_key`/`references` hints,
full state sync, and **zero-config** runs inside Databricks notebooks. → [dlt.md](dlt.md)

**dbt** — `dbt-databricks` ~**1.11.x**. The new Rust **Fusion** engine supports Databricks in **beta**;
new dbt Cloud environments provision on a Fusion release track by default. Fusion ignores user-set
threads on Databricks and auto-optimizes parallelism. → [dbt.md](dbt.md)

**Databricks** — **DLT (Delta Live Tables) was renamed to Lakeflow Spark Declarative Pipelines (SDP)**;
existing code runs unchanged. Jan–Feb 2026 SDP additions: **type widening** for Delta (no full reset),
**data-quality expectations stored in Unity Catalog**, **queued execution mode**, and **new flow
syntax** for streaming tables. → [databricks.md](databricks.md)

**Watch / opportunities** — Iceberg-on-UC + dlt is an area worth a hands-on writeup; potential upstream
example contribution to dlt or dbt-databricks docs. (See updates/README.md.)
